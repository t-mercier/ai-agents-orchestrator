# Screenshot regeneration

`docs/media/*.png` is generated, not hand-captured. Run this after any UI change that
alters what the docs show — a toolbar button, the card layout, the settings panel:

```bash
./scripts/screenshots/capture.sh              # every shot → docs/media/
./scripts/screenshots/capture.sh hero board   # only those scenes
OUT=/tmp/shots ./scripts/screenshots/capture.sh   # dry run, writes elsewhere
```

Env: `CHROME` (browser binary, auto-detected on macOS + Linux), `PORT` (default 8752),
`OUT` (default `docs/media`).

## How it works

It does **not** screenshot the packaged app — that would put your own sessions in the
docs. It serves `renderer/` (the very files the app ships) to headless Chrome with the
Rust backend stubbed by [`fixture.js`](fixture.js), which supplies a synthetic set of
sessions. So the output is the real UI, is reproducible, and leaks nothing.

`renderer/index.html` is **not** copied here — `capture.sh` derives the scene page from
it at run time, injecting a `<base>` and the fixture. A vendored copy would silently
drift from the real file. The script asserts on the two anchors it patches, so it fails
loudly if `index.html` moves them.

| Scene | Output | Shows |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | `hero.png` | List view, a waiting session selected |
| `light` | `light.png` | same, light theme |
| `rose` | `look-rose.png` | same, "Rose Poudré" look |
| `board` | `board.png` | Board: a group, an urgent flag, attached notes |
| `settings` | `settings.png` | Settings → Appearance over the board |
| `terminal` | `terminal.png` | Embedded terminal, output pushed through the real `pty-data` path |

Add a shot: add a scene to `fixture.js`, then a `scene:file:w:h` line to `SHOTS` in
`capture.sh`.

## Two things that will look like bugs

- **Chrome hangs after writing the PNG.** The page keeps a live event loop (the app
  polls every 5s), so Chrome's virtual-time budget never drains and it won't exit on its
  own. `capture.sh` launches it detached, waits for the file size to settle, then kills
  it. The fixture also clears pending timers once a scene is set, which is what lets the
  screenshot fire at all.
- **Should a landing-page scene ever come back**: a full-height capture of
  `docs/index.html` comes out black. It fades its sections in on scroll
  (IntersectionObserver), so anything below the viewport is transparent at capture time.
  Shoot it at viewport height and verify the rest through the DOM. The README used to carry
  such a shot as its banner; it now shows `hero.png`, because a screenshot of the landing
  page repeated the title, the headline and the opening line as an unreadable image, and had
  to be re-shot whenever that copy changed.

## Fidelity notes

The dataset intentionally reuses the session names and copy of the original screenshots
(`checkout-redesign`, `payments-api`, …) so regenerated docs stay visually continuous.
Timestamps come from the clock at capture time, so the "LAST UPDATE" line and the age
pills change run to run — those pixels are the only non-deterministic part.
