  Wrap up a session UNATTENDED — the headless twin of /close-session, run by the
  dashboard's Close button. Summarises the conversation into the notes.md it is given,
  refreshes the PR / ticket frontmatter, and stamps the Session history entry that marks
  the session Closed. Asks nothing, distils nothing, proposes nothing. Trigger on
  "/wrap-session <notes_path> <session_id>".

# /wrap-session — wrap up, and only that

`/close-session` run without a human in front of it. It exists because the dashboard's
**Close** button wraps a stale session without opening a terminal: the app resumes the
session with `--print`, which means **nothing can answer a question**. So this skill asks
none, and does only what a wrap-up strictly is — steps 1 to 6 of `/close-session`.

Deliberately NOT here: the knowledge-notes distil and the skill proposal. Those are
judgement calls that deserve a human, and they stay in `/close-session`, which you run
yourself.

## Arguments (both required)

```
/wrap-session <notes_path> <session_id>
```

**Take both from the arguments. Never resolve them yourself.** `--resume` runs the
conversation under a NEW session id, so the usual pid/registry lookup would find this
headless process rather than the session being wrapped, and the close marker would point
at an id that no one can resume. `<session_id>` is the ORIGINAL session — the one whose
conversation you are reading right now.

Missing argument, or `<notes_path>` is not an existing file → print one line saying so and
stop. Do not guess a path: the wrong notes.md would be overwritten with another session's
summary.

## Step 1 — Read the notes

Read `<notes_path>`. Note `category`, `ticket`, `name`, `branch` from the frontmatter.

## Step 2 — Build the summary (from THIS conversation)

The conversation was restored by `--resume`, so it is the session's real history. Gather:

- **Decisions made** — date-prefixed (`YYYY-MM-DD:`) one-liners (architecture/approach choices).
- **Files touched** — paths + a one-line note (pull from Edit/Write calls).
- **Open questions** — tick off any now-resolved `[ ]`; append genuinely new ones.
- **Next steps** — a QUEUE of what to do next, never a log of what was done. Rewrite it in full each time:
  - **At most 7 items, all open (`- [ ]`), one line each, ≤100 characters, imperative.** If an item needs a paragraph to justify it, it is an **Open question**, not a step.
  - **A finished item is DELETED, not ticked.** Its record already exists twice — in *Decisions made* (dated, with the reason) and in *Session history*. The third copy, undated and unreadable, is what turned one session's list into 99 lines (270 in another).
  - **The first line is the top priority and nothing else** — no preamble, no parenthesised status line. The dashboard reads that first line as the card's "where was I" cue and truncates it at 64 characters, so anything else there is what the session looks like from the outside.
- **One-line summary** — a concrete result in past tense, 10–15 words (not "worked on X").

Skip noise (don't list every read/grep).

## Step 3 — Frontmatter refresh (append-only)

A session can reference several PRs and tickets, held as a primary value plus a list of
extras. **Append only** — never remove a link, never overwrite a value with empty:

```yaml
pr_link: https://github.com/o/r/pull/12    # primary — shown on the card
pr_links:
  - https://github.com/o/r/pull/15
ticket: FEAT-1842
tickets:
  - FEAT-1877
```

Collect every PR URL this session is about:

- `gh pr view --json url -q .url` on the session's branch. A valid
  `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N` → use it.
- The PRs created or handled in THIS conversation (scan it) — `gh` only ever reports the
  current branch's, so this is how a session's *other* PR is found.

Add any URL not already present, keeping the existing primary as the primary. Same for
tickets matching `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*-[0-9]+$`, uppercased.

Record each ticket's status too, when this session actually saw one — a tracker lookup, a
status you were told, a transition you performed. Never invent one, and never leave an
entry you now know is wrong: an out-of-date status shown as current is worse than none.

```yaml
ticket_states:                             # one entry per ticket, the tracker's own words
  - GOSDK-201341: In Review
```

If `ticket:` was empty and you just filled it, patch `~/.claude/active-sessions.json` for
`<session_id>` by **merging**: set `ticket` only, preserving `notes_path`, `category`,
`name`, `started_at`. The registry mirrors the primary ticket alone.

## Step 4 — Update the notes.md sections

With the Edit tool: append to **Decisions made** and **Files touched**, update **Open
questions** (tick resolved, add new), replace **Next steps**.

## Step 5 — Stamp the Session history (ALWAYS — this is the close marker)

```bash
NOW=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
```

Append under `## Session history`:

```
- <NOW> | session=<session_id> | <one-line summary>
```

`<session_id>` is the **argument**, not the id of this headless run — the line has to name
the session someone would resume.

This line is what moves the session to **Closed**. Always write it, even when nothing new
happened (`reclosed — no new work since the last close`). Only skip it when the latest
entry is already a close dated **today**.

## Step 6 — Confirm in one line

Print what changed: sections updated, links attached, the history line written. The app
shows this back to the user, so keep it to a single line.

If you got this far without writing the Session history entry, say so explicitly — the app
falls back to stamping a plain close marker itself, and it needs to know it must.
