"""Parse, verify, diff and apply a staged skill patch proposal.

Why this exists: a patch's `new_string` routinely contains fenced code blocks of its own
(a bash example, a JQL snippet). With a plain ``` fence around it, where the block ends is
ambiguous — a parser can silently take the wrong slice and write mangled instructions into
a skill, which then shapes every future session. So the format uses an OUTER fence longer
than anything inside it (CommonMark: a fence closes only on a run of at least its own
length), and this tool is the single implementation of that rule.

It refuses rather than guesses: an anchor that does not match exactly once, an unclosed
fence, or an outer fence no longer than an inner one all abort with a non-zero exit.

    python3 patch_apply.py check <proposal.patch.md>   # parse + anchor check only
    python3 patch_apply.py diff  <proposal.patch.md>   # unified diff of what apply would do
    python3 patch_apply.py apply <proposal.patch.md>   # write it (after check)
