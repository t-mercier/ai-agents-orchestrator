# /close-session — wrap up the active session

Summarises the current session into its `notes.md` and stamps the Session history.
Nothing is deleted; the session can be resumed later.

## Step 0 — Mode check

If plan mode is active (a `Plan mode is active` system reminder is present): stop and print:

> ⚠️ Plan mode is active — this skill writes files and will be blocked.
> Switch to auto mode, then re-run `/close-session`.

## Step 1 — Resolve the current session ID

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(python3 -c "
import json, os, glob, subprocess

def ancestors(pid):
    result = set()
    while pid > 1:
        try:
            out = subprocess.run(['ps', '-p', str(pid), '-o', 'ppid='],
                                 capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
            pid = int(out)
            result.add(pid)
        except: break
    return result

mine = ancestors(os.getpid())
for f in sorted(glob.glob(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/sessions/*.json')), key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True):
    try:
        pid = int(os.path.basename(f).replace('.json', ''))
        if pid in mine:
            d = json.load(open(f))
            sid = d.get('sessionId', '')
            if sid:
                print(sid); break
    except Exception:
        pass
")
```

## Step 2 — Find the registered notes.md

```bash
NOTES_PATH=$(python3 - "$SESSION_ID" <<'PY'
import json, os, sys
sid = sys.argv[1]
p = os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/active-sessions.json')
try: d = json.load(open(p))
except Exception: d = {}
print((d.get(sid) or {}).get('notes_path', ''))
PY
)

# Relink fallback: a RESUMED session's id is often absent from active-sessions.json (it
# was closed/archived → de-registered), but its managed notes.md still records the id as a
# `session=<id>` history line. Find that notes.md so the close lands in the RIGHT place
# instead of nowhere. Searches each configured category folder via aoconfig.
if [ -z "$NOTES_PATH" ] && [ -n "$SESSION_ID" ]; then
  while IFS= read -r cat; do
    [ -z "$cat" ] && continue
    base=$(python3 ~/.claude/skills/lib/aoconfig.py base "$cat" 2>/dev/null)
    [ -z "$base" ] && continue
    hit=$(grep -rl "session=$SESSION_ID" "$base"/*/notes.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    [ -n "$hit" ] && { NOTES_PATH="$hit"; break; }
  done < <(python3 ~/.claude/skills/lib/aoconfig.py categories 2>/dev/null)
fi
```

If `$NOTES_PATH` is empty: stop and tell the user there's no active session registered
for this conversation — run `/start-session` (new) or `/restart-session <slug>` (resume) first.

## Step 3 — Read the notes + frontmatter

Read `$NOTES_PATH`. Note `category`, `ticket`, `name`, `branch` from the frontmatter.

## Step 4 — Build the summary (from THIS conversation)

From the work done in this session, gather:
- **Decisions made** — date-prefixed (`YYYY-MM-DD:`) one-liners (architecture/approach choices).
- **Files touched** — paths + a one-line note (pull from Edit/Write calls).
- **Open questions** — tick off any now-resolved `[ ]`; append genuinely new ones.
- **Next steps** — a todo-list (`- [ ]` items, ≤7 open items, one line each). Mark completed work as `- [x]` (don't delete). Max 7 open items total.
- **One-line summary** — a concrete result in past tense, 10–15 words (not "worked on X").

Skip noise (don't list every read/grep). **Re-validate Goal** if it's drifted (rewrite in one line if needed).

## Step 5 — Frontmatter refresh (auto-attach PR / ticket)

A session can reference SEVERAL PRs and tickets — one task split across two PRs, or an
epic plus its sub-task. The frontmatter holds them as a primary value plus a list of
extras, and this step **APPENDS** to that list; it never replaces what's already there:

```yaml
pr_link: https://github.com/o/r/pull/12    # primary — shown on the card
pr_links:                                  # extras, in order (omit the key when there are none)
  - https://github.com/o/r/pull/15
ticket: FEAT-1842
tickets:
  - FEAT-1877
```

Collect every PR URL this session is about:
- Deterministic source: `gh pr view --json url -q .url` on the current branch (session's repo). A valid GitHub PR URL (`https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/N`) → use it.
- Also the PRs Claude created/manipulated in THIS conversation (scan it for GitHub PR URLs) — that's how the session's *other* PR is found, since `gh` only ever reports the current branch's.

Then, with the Edit tool: add any URL **not already** in `pr_link:` / `pr_links:`, keeping
the existing primary as the primary (a session's first PR stays its headline). Write extras
as `pr_links:` list items. NEVER remove a link and NEVER overwrite a value with empty — the
dashboard's PR editor is where links get pruned, deliberately.

Same for tickets matching `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*-[0-9]+$` created/identified in the session:
1. Uppercase them.
2. Add any that aren't already in `ticket:` / `tickets:` (primary first, extras as list items).
3. If `ticket:` was empty and you just filled it, patch `active-sessions.json` by reading the current entry for `SESSION_ID` and MERGING: set only `ticket`, preserve `notes_path`, `category`, `name`, `started_at` (do NOT replace the whole entry). The registry mirrors the PRIMARY ticket only — extras live in notes.md alone.

4. **Record each ticket's status**, when this session actually saw it — a tracker
   lookup, a status you were told, a transition you performed. Never invent one, and
   never keep an older entry you now know is wrong: an out-of-date status shown as
   current is worse than none.

```yaml
ticket_states:                             # one entry per ticket, the tracker's own words
  - GOSDK-201341: In Review
  - GOSDK-221110: Triaged
```

   The dashboard shows that word as-is and only derives its COLOUR (in flight /
   finished / abandoned / not started), so a project-specific status stays readable.

The dashboard's ticket / PR icons fill automatically once the frontmatter is right; with
several links they show a count badge and open a picker.

## Step 5b — Update notes.md sections

Use the Edit tool to: append new bullets to **Decisions made** and **Files touched**;
update **Open questions** (tick resolved, add new); replace **Next steps** with the
updated list.

## Step 6 — Append a Session history entry (ALWAYS — this is the close marker)

```bash
NOW=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
```

**Always** append a closing entry under `## Session history` (Edit tool) — this line is what marks the session **Closed**; without a fresh one, a resumed session lingers as *stale*. Do not skip it as a "no-op" even when nothing new happened.

```
- <NOW> | session=<SESSION_ID> | <one-line summary>
```

- **No new work since the last close?** Still append a brief line, e.g. `- <NOW> | session=<SESSION_ID> | reclosed — no new work since the last close`.
- **Only skip** if the latest existing entry is already a close dated **today** (avoids a same-day duplicate). An older close (a previous day) does not count — append a fresh one.

## Step 7 — Optional: distil to the knowledge notes (gated)

Only if a vault is configured for this category's scope:

```bash
VAULT=$(python3 ~/.claude/skills/lib/aoconfig.py vault "<CATEGORY>")
```

`$VAULT` empty → skip silently.

Otherwise **follow `/learn` (its Steps 3–5)** for each decision worth keeping, one note per
decision, with `origin: close-session` and `session: <CATEGORY>/<slug>`. Do not write a
per-session file: a dump of one session is a fifth copy of `notes.md`, it carries no id, no
frontmatter and no index row, so the search cannot rank it and nothing links to it. `/learn`
is the single writer that knows the vault's schema — going through it is what keeps the
notes one coherent, searchable set, and it extends an existing note instead of adding a
near-duplicate.

Promote only what a *future, different* session would be glad to find, and mark each
promoted bullet in `notes.md` (a trailing `↑`) so the next close does not promote it
again.

## Step 7b — Optional: propose a skill from what this session taught (gated)

The procedural twin of the knowledge distil above: that one promotes *facts*, this one
promotes *how we got there*. Gated, so it is off unless explicitly enabled:

```bash
PROPOSE=$(python3 ~/.claude/skills/lib/aoconfig.py flag skillProposals)
```

**`$PROPOSE` empty** → skip **silently**. Do not mention it in the confirmation.

**`$PROPOSE` = `on`** → follow the `/skill-propose` skill against this session (its Steps
1–4). Do not restate its criteria here — that skill owns them. Two properties matter:

- It is **silent unless one of its four criteria actually fired**, so an ordinary session
  produces nothing. No proposal is the normal outcome.
- It **never changes a skill without the user having seen the exact wording**. This runs
  headless with no one to answer, so here it always stages under
  `~/.claude/skills-pending/` for `/skills-review`.

Mention a staged proposal in the confirmation (one line, with which criterion fired);
say nothing when there is none.

## Step 8 — Confirm

Print a short confirmation: frontmatter refresh result (PR link / ticket updated, or already set), which sections were updated, the Session history line
added, and (if applicable) the vault note written. Remind the user they can resume
later with `/restart-session <slug>` or start fresh.
