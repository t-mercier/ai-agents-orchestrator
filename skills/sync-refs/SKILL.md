# /sync-refs — realign a session's tickets and PRs

The dashboard's **Sync** button, run with `--print`, so **nothing may ask a question**.

It exists because two facts drift on their own: a ticket's status changes in the tracker,
and a pull request gets opened long after the session's notes were last written. The app
cannot read either — it holds no tracker credentials, and it does not know which branches
belong to a session. An agent does, through MCP and `gh`.

Deliberately NOT here: summarising, closing, distilling, editing prose. This rewrites two
frontmatter keys and stops.

## Arguments

```
/sync-refs <notes_path>
```

`<notes_path>` is not an existing file → print one line saying so and stop. Never guess a
path: the wrong notes.md would be rewritten with another session's references.

## Step 1 — Read the frontmatter

Read `<notes_path>` and note:

- `ticket:` + `tickets:` — every ticket this session is about.
- `ticket_states:` — what we believed last time.
- `pr_link:` + `pr_links:` — the pull requests already attached.
- `branch:` — the branch last recorded, useful but not authoritative.

No tickets and no PRs → nothing to sync. Say so in one line and stop.

## Step 2 — Ticket statuses, from the tracker

For each ticket, fetch its **current status** through the Atlassian MCP tools (or whichever
tracker MCP is configured). Use the tracker's own wording — `Ready For Review`, `Triaged`,
`Aborted` — never a normalised version of it: the dashboard derives its colour from the
word but shows the word itself, and a project's vocabulary is the useful part.

Rewrite `ticket_states:` in full:

```yaml
ticket_states:
  - GOSDK-201341: Ready For Review
  - GOSDK-221110: Aborted
```

**Replace, do not append.** A status is a snapshot, and this is exactly the key whose stale
value is worse than none — an old "Triaged" shown as current is what makes the board lie.
Drop the entry for a ticket the tracker cannot answer for, rather than keeping the last
known value.

If no tracker MCP is available, leave `ticket_states:` **untouched** and say so in the
confirmation. Silently wiping the statuses because a tool was missing would look like every
ticket lost its status.

## Step 3 — Pull requests, from `gh`

A session's PRs are the ones whose branch names one of its tickets — that is the convention
the branches follow (`fix/GOSDK-221743-…`, `test/GOSDK-201341-…`).

Search each repository that already appears in `pr_link:` / `pr_links:`; that is how the
repo is known without guessing. With no PR attached yet, use the git repository of the
current directory if it is one.

```bash
gh pr list --repo <owner/repo> --state all --limit 60 --json number,url,headRefName,title
```

Keep a PR when its `headRefName` contains one of the session's ticket ids.

**No repository known at all** (no PR attached, and the current directory is not a
checkout — the dashboard's Sync runs from the session folder, which usually is not one):
do not skip. Search by ticket instead, across everything the account can see:

```bash
gh search prs "<TICKET>" --author @me --limit 20 --json url,title,repository   # open and closed alike; --state would narrow it
```

GitHub's search reads titles and bodies, not branch names, so this catches a PR whose
title or description names the ticket (`Implements: <TICKET>`) and misses one that only
names it in the branch. Keep a result when its `title` names one of the session's ticket
ids; treat the rest as noise, not as the session's. This is the fallback, not the rule —
when a repo IS known, the branch-name rule above stays authoritative.

Add every PR kept, by either route, that is not already listed — keeping the existing
`pr_link:` as the primary (a session's first PR stays its headline) and writing the rest
as `pr_links:` entries.

**Append only. Never remove a PR link**, whatever `gh` says: a link the user attached by
hand is a deliberate act, and a branch can be deleted while its PR still matters. Pruning
is the dashboard's editor, on purpose.

## Step 4 — Confirm in one line

Print what changed: how many ticket statuses were refreshed, which PRs were newly attached,
or that nothing moved. **In English**, whatever language the surrounding session uses — this
line is app UI, not conversation. One line: the app shows it as-is.

Worth flagging when it happens: a ticket the tracker redirected to another key (a moved
project). Name both keys — the status is real but it no longer belongs to the id in the
notes, and only the user can decide what to do about that.
