//! In-app session-skills installer.
//!
//! The session skills (`/start-session`, `/close-session`, …) only work when they
//! live in `~/.claude/skills/` — Claude Code never reads them from inside the app
//! bundle. So the bundle merely *carries* them: `include_dir!` embeds `../skills`
//! into the binary at compile time, and this module copies them out to
//! `~/.claude/skills/` on request. That makes a `.dmg`-only install self-sufficient
//! (no git clone + `install.sh` needed) and lets the app refresh the skills after an
//! upgrade.
//!
//! This is the one place the app writes under `~/.claude` besides the two explicit
//! session-data writes (archive, PR link), and it only ever touches
//! `~/.claude/skills/` (app-owned lifecycle skills), never session transcripts.
//!
//! Embedding via `include_dir!` (rather than Tauri `bundle.resources`) means the
//! path resolves identically in `tauri dev` and the bundled app — no resource-dir
//! divergence, no `_up_` path rewriting.
