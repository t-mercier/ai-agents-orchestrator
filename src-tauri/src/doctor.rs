//! Doctor — find what is genuinely broken in the session store, and repair it on request.
//!
//! Two rules shape this module, and both are about trust rather than capability.
//!
//! **It proposes, it never repairs on its own.** A registry rewrite is as silent and as
//! durable as a clobbered skill, so `scan` is read-only and returns named findings; the
//! user picks, and `repair` applies only what was picked. Doctor has the widest write
//! radius in the app — it does not get to run without a witness.
//!
//! **It only reports what it can prove.** Most of what looks wrong in the store is not:
//! a session id whose transcript Claude Code pruned months ago is normal ageing, and a
//! notes.md registered under six ids is the Resume fallback working as designed
//! (`reader::latest_resumable_sid` scans exactly that multiplicity to find a live id).
//! Counting those as damage would put a four-figure defect count on the first run and
//! cost the tool its credibility. The classifier below deliberately finds few things.
