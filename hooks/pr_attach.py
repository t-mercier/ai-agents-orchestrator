"""PostToolUse hook: attach a pull request to the session's notes.md the moment it exists.

The dashboard reads a session's pull requests from the `pr_link:` / `pr_links:`
frontmatter of its notes.md, and only /start-session, /save-session and /close-session
ever write those keys. A PR opened mid-session therefore stays invisible until the next
checkpoint — the session shows no PR at all, which is exactly when the link matters.

This hook closes that gap, on both roads a PR takes to exist from inside a session:
  - `gh pr create` / `gh pr edit` / `gh pr reopen` in a Bash call — each prints the URL of
    the one PR it acted on, and nothing else. (`edit` and `reopen` cost nothing extra: the
    URL is the same one, already attached or not yet.)
  - a GitHub MCP tool named `…create_pull_request` — its result carries the new PR's
    `html_url`.

Two guards, because unlike the other hooks this one WRITES:
  1. the Bash command must be one of those three — never `list`, `view`, `checks`, whose
     output is full of other people's PR URLs;
  2. the URL must come from the tool RESPONSE, not the input. A create that failed prints
     no URL, and a `--body` mentioning "depends on .../pull/12" must not be mistaken for
     the PR that was just opened.

Writes are idempotent (a URL already attached is a no-op), additive (an existing link is
never replaced or removed) and atomic (the app polls notes.md every 5s and must never
read a half-written file).

Silent and exit 0 on every path — a broken hook must not make a successful
`gh pr create` look like a failure.
