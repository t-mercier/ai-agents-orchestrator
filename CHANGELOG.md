# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

> Add entries under **[Unreleased]** as you go; when you tag a release, rename that
> section to the version + date and start a fresh **[Unreleased]** above it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pinned skills — three slots in the titlebar, three on a session.** Any skill under
  `~/.claude/skills` can be put on a button. Where it runs is decided by the session's
  state, not by you: an open, idle terminal gets the slash command typed in (you see it
  land in your own scrollback); with no terminal it runs headless, resuming the session
  when it has a usable id; a session that is **working or waiting is refused**, with the
  reason said out loud — a pty write during a turn lands inside that turn. The global
  slots have no session, so they always run headless from your home folder. Picks are
  stored in `config.json` under `pinnedSkills`; the picker lists what is installed, the
  app's own set flagged.

## [0.16.3-alpha] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- **A card's "where was I" cue pointed at work already finished.** The cue is the first line
  of the notes' *Next steps* section, and that line was taken as-is — so a ticked item or a
  parenthesised preamble won simply by coming first. Across 129 real sessions, 49 cards
  showed one. `firstNextStep` now takes the first OPEN step, skips ticked and struck-through
  items, ignores a preamble, and drops the checkbox marker it used to print; it moved into
  `renderer/lib/formatters.js` so it is covered by tests (8 new).

## [0.16.2-alpha] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **Board: the PR and ticket pickers on a card did nothing for a session the List was
  not showing.** The card came from the board's own index, which spans every state, but
  the click resolved the session against the List's current tab only — so a closed or
  archived session (typically a `notes.md` that was never attached to a live session)
  had a working icon in the List and a dead one on the board. The picker, its
  "Add / edit" row and the drawer's detail actions now fall back to the board index
  when the List tab does not know the key.

## [0.16.1-alpha] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **`/sync-refs` is a fixed sequence of five calls.** Transcripts showed one run making a
  single JQL query and the next a lookup per ticket, and `gh` loops without `< /dev/null`
  (gh reads the loop's stdin and truncates the list). Now: one read, one `key in (…)` JQL,
  one `gh pr list --json` per known repo filtered locally by `jq` (or one `gh search prs` by
  ticket when no repo is known — no `--state` flag, search has none), one edit, one line.
  A run that needs more is a run that went wrong, and says so.

## [0.16.0-alpha] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- **The app's 14 skills are the app's — not customisable, by decision.** They write the
  `notes.md` the dashboard reads; a customised one breaks the app silently, and every release
  overwrote the edit anyway, keeping a copy in `.archive/` that nobody merged. Three things now
  hold the line: a new `ao_skill_guard` hook (`PreToolUse` on `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit`)
  refuses an agent's edit to one and says to make a skill of your own instead; the files are
  installed read-only (`chmod 444`, the app unlocks them only to write its own update); and a copy
  forced anyway is **restored** at the next sync and named — no archive, no merge. `patch_apply.py`
  refuses an app-owned target and `/skill-propose` turns such a proposal into a new skill seeded
  from the app's copy. Want different behaviour? Copy the skill under another name and change
  that one — nothing touches it. `install.sh` follows the same rule (`RESTORED`, not `ARCHIVED`).
- **The launch notice is one line.** "Session skills updated to this app version: x, y. Open a
  fresh Claude Code session…" read as an instruction — people looked for what to run. Now:
  "Skills updated for this version: x, y — nothing to do."

## [0.15.0-alpha] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- **Every pull request reaches its session, whichever road it took.** `pr_attach` matched
  only `gh pr create` inside a Bash call, so a PR opened through the GitHub MCP server's
  `create_pull_request` was never attached, silently. The hook now also fires for that tool
  (matcher `Bash|mcp__.*__create_pull_request`, the tool name whatever the server is
  registered as) and for `gh pr edit` / `gh pr reopen` — same URL, no extra cost, and it
  catches a PR adopted mid-session. The URL is still taken only from the tool's result, never
  from its input. And `/sync-refs` Step 3 no longer skips when no repository is known: it
  searches your PRs by ticket (`gh search prs`), the fallback for a Sync run from a session
  folder that is not a checkout. A `pr_attach` already declared under a plain `Bash` matcher (every install before 0.15)
  keeps working for `gh` and cannot see the MCP tool; step 4 now reports it as not fully
  enabled and adds an MCP-only group beside yours — never widening your own group, whose
  other hooks must not start seeing a tool they never asked for. Sessions started from the
  app get that same MCP-only group injected without any edit.
- **The checkpoint happens on its own.** `/save-session` only ever ran when someone typed it,
  and the moment it matters — context nearly full, a compaction about to erase the detail — is
  the moment nobody remembers to. Three new hooks ship with the app: `ao_autosave` (`Stop`) has
  the model run `/save-session` itself at 60 % and 80 % of context and after 30 minutes without
  a checkpoint, from the session's real context figure in the statusline cache rather than a
  transcript byte count; `ao_precompact` appends an `(in progress)` history line with the
  transcript path before each compaction; `ao_session_start` states the `/learn` habit at every
  tracked session's start and, after a compaction with stale notes, asks for the save first.
  **Every session started from the dashboard runs all five hooks with no settings.json edit**:
  the app already passed Claude Code a `--settings` file for the statusline, Claude Code merges
  that file's hooks with the global ones (verified: an injected hook and a global one both fired
  in one run), so the shipped hooks the user has not wired globally ride in it. Wiring them in
  the wizard's step 4 remains the way to cover sessions started from a plain terminal.
- **`/save-session` distils to the knowledge notes** (new Step 5c, gated on a configured vault,
  the same step `/close-session` had). Its skill-proposal step already referred to "the distil
  above" — there was none. A checkpoint is when a decision is fresh, and a session that is never
  closed taught the next one nothing.
- **Sync all** — one titlebar button runs the per-card Sync for every open session that has
  a ticket or a pull request. Ten open sessions used to mean ten clicks and ten waits. The
  order is what makes it one wait: every known PR state first, in one `gh` batch (the list is
  fresher within seconds), then `/sync-refs` one session at a time — sequential on purpose,
  one headless `claude` on the machine and on the rate limit — then a second `gh` batch for
  the PRs the agents discovered. A notice shows which session is under way and ends on a
  receipt that names any failure. A missing or logged-out `gh` stops the run before any agent
  starts: it is one thing to fix, not N failures to read. Still silent on the network until
  you press it. The decisions are a pure model (`lib/sync-all-model.js`), tested.
- **After `git pull`, the app offers to update its skills and hooks.** A pull moves the repo's
  `skills/` and `hooks/`; the copies Claude Code loads in `~/.claude/skills/` stay where they
  were, and until now the only warning was a paragraph in the README. `install.sh` records the
  checkout it ran from in the install manifest; the app asks git whether that checkout is ahead
  of what is installed — at launch and whenever the window regains focus, never on the poll —
  and, when it is, a notice offers **Update**, which runs that checkout's `install.sh --all`
  (a changed copy of an app skill archived first, your own skills never in scope). The path
  executed is the manifest's, not the renderer's. Dismiss is per checkout date, so the next
  pull asks again. Nothing appears for a `.dmg`-only install, which has no checkout to compare.
  The bundle date now counts commits to `hooks/` as well as `skills/`, on all three sides
  (`build.rs`, `install.sh`, the check).
- **The two hooks ship with the app, and first-run setup can switch them on.** They existed
  only in the repo, copied by `install.sh --with-hooks` — so anyone installing the `.dmg`,
  the path the README recommends, could not reach them at all. They are embedded in the
  binary now like the skills, and copied on every launch. Copying is inert (a script nothing
  references never runs); **enabling** one adds a line to `~/.claude/settings.json`, so it
  stays a separate, explicit act: the wizard's new last step shows the exact file it would
  write, backs the current one up with a timestamp, then writes atomically. The merge is
  pure and tested — it joins an existing `Bash` matcher instead of adding a rival one, is
  idempotent, treats a hand-tuned command line as already-enabled, and preserves everything
  else in the file.
- **First-run setup ends on step 4, "Skills & hooks"** — the place a newcomer learns that the
  buttons don't do the work (each opens Claude Code on a session skill), where the skills
  live, and that their own skills are never in scope. The launch banner stands down while
  the wizard is pending: it asked the same question, and its dismiss is permanent.
- **The model is choosable, and the app stops overriding your Claude Code default.**
  `opus[1m]` was hard-coded into `claude --model` at nine call sites, so every ＋New, Resume,
  Close and Sync silently overrode whatever `model` you had set in `settings.json`. The new
  `claudeModel` key defaults to empty, which means **send no `--model` at all** and let your
  own setting decide; pick one in step 4 or Settings → Terminal to override it explicitly.
- **`install.sh --all`** — `--force` plus the hook-enabling lines, in one command, instead of
  learning two flags from the README.
- **`advisorModel` too**, at the same place. It is Claude Code's own key — nothing to do with
  the sessions this app launches — but this is now the one screen that edits `settings.json`
  with the result shown first and a backup taken, so it rides that path rather than growing
  a second one. An empty choice leaves the key alone rather than clearing it.

### Fixed
- **The hook scripts were embedded but nothing copied them.** Wiring would have pointed
  `settings.json` at a missing file — and both hooks end in `2>/dev/null; true`, so it would
  have failed in complete silence. They now travel with the skills, in `install_skills` and
  `sync_skills` alike.
- **`--force` now backs up before it replaces.** The app's launch sync had always copied a
  hand-edited skill into `.archive/<name>.pre-sync-<timestamp>/` first; the installer script
  did a plain `rm -rf`, so the two disagreed on whether "nothing is ever lost" was true. It
  is true now on both sides, and the run names every backup it made.
- **`install.sh` still gated the *copy* behind `--with-hooks`.** Gating an inert copy is what
  made the hooks unreachable in the first place; every run copies them now, and the flag only
  decides whether the lines that enable them are printed.

### Changed
- **The README and the guide now explain what the skills are for and what an install touches.**
  They are what does the work — the dashboard's buttons only launch them, and without them a
  button opens a session that does nothing. Both documents now show where the skills live, what
  `.ao-base/` and `.archive/` are, and state plainly that your own skills are never in scope:
  both installers work through the 14 names this app ships, and the one exception — a skill of
  yours sharing one of those names — is archived before being replaced.
- The guide's `/start-session` row still said git runs "only if a branch was given" — the same
  claim the README shed in 0.13.1, in its twin table. Corrected.


## [0.14.1-alpha] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **A session reopened the same day it was closed no longer sits in Closed for two days.**
  The check for "closed, then resumed and worked on" compared `/close-session`'s **local**
  calendar stamp against the transcript's **UTC** mtime. Those are different frames, off by
  up to a day at the boundary, and the fix for that had been to demand a gap of more than a
  full day — which made a same-day reopen invisible until the day after next. Reported from a
  real session: closed at 11:49, worked in until 19:03, and it stayed in Closed all
  afternoon, out of the board group its owner had put it in, with nothing to do but wait.
  The check now also compares the transcript's mtime against the notes file's own mtime —
  two instants off the same clock, so no timezone conversion exists to be wrong — with a
  30-minute margin for the close turn still writing itself into the transcript. The old
  day-granularity rule stays as a floor, for the case where no `notes.md` is on disk.
- **The installer's own last line was recommending a git-worktree plugin.** After every
  install from source it printed *"Optional: install the Superpowers plugin for git-worktree
  support"* — the loudest surviving source of the belief that this app needs worktrees, which
  the README, the guide and `/start-session` all spent 0.13.1 disowning. The recommendation
  stays, stripped of the implication and prefixed by what is actually true: nothing here uses
  or creates a worktree.
- **A plain `install.sh` no longer hides the two optional hooks.** It copied neither and named
  neither, so the only way to learn `--with-hooks` existed was to read the README. The run now
  ends by naming `pr_attach.py` and `learn_nudge.py`, what each does, and that re-running with
  the flag is safe.
- **`install.sh` seeded the deprecated `obsidian` key** while the app's own seeder writes
  `knowledge`, so which installer ran first decided what a fresh config said. Both work — the
  legacy name is still read — but a new install started life on the old one.
- **A typo'd flag was dropped in silence.** `--with-hook` installed nothing and said nothing,
  which is the worst outcome for an option you have to know about to use. Unknown flags now
  exit 2 with a usage block, and `--help` prints it.

## [0.14.0-alpha] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **A session can now open in any folder, not only a git checkout.** The ＋New form's
  **Repo** field became **Start in** and accepts any directory — a notes tree, a scratch
  folder, a docs directory. Before, `validate_repo` refused anything without a `.git`, so
  **Browse…** let you pick a folder and Start then rejected it with *"that folder is not a
  git repository"*; without a repo the session always opened at the space root, and there was
  no way to say "open here". **Branch** is the one thing that still requires a checkout,
  since there is otherwise nothing to check it out in — and it now says so.
- This also gives the git behaviour an off switch that is not "leave it blank": point
  **Start in** at a folder outside any repo and session start never touches git at all.

### Changed
- **The README's banner is now the app, not a screenshot of the landing page.** That banner
  repeated the three things directly under it — the title, the headline and the opening line
  on compaction — as an 820px image nobody can select, search or read on a phone, and it had
  to be re-shot whenever the landing copy changed. It shows `hero.png` instead, so the top of
  the README answers "what does this look like?" and is no longer coupled to marketing copy.
  The `banner` scene is gone from `scripts/screenshots/`, and the List/Board table below now
  shows only the Board, since the List view is the shot at the top.

### Fixed
- **Regenerated `docs/media/*.png`.** Every shot still showed `＋ Import` and the
  "Recent · unmanaged" row, both removed in 0.12.0 — so the README banner and the landing
  page advertised a surface that no longer exists. Reshot from `scripts/screenshots/`, which
  serves the real renderer against a synthetic fixture, so the hero, the board, the light and
  Rose Poudré looks, Settings, the terminal and the landing-page banner are all current.

## [0.13.1-alpha] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **Said plainly that git is optional and that no worktree is ever involved.** A tester
  abandoned the app on the belief that it required `git worktree` — which it does not, and
  never creates: a "Worktree" row appears in the detail panel only when a session already
  happens to run inside a linked one. The docs invited the mistake by calling a session's
  folder a **workspace** and its git step *"syncs the repo"*, so both wordings are gone from
  the README, the guide and `/start-session`'s own description. That folder holds only its
  `notes.md`; it is not a checkout.
- **The ＋New form now warns where the decision is actually made.** What triggers git is not
  the Branch field but whether the session starts **inside a repo** — the **Repo** field when
  you give one, the space's root otherwise. `/start-session` reads the branch from
  `git branch --show-current`, so giving a Repo alone runs `git fetch --all --prune` and
  rebases, with Branch left blank. The Branch field carries that warning, and the guide now
  states which of the two rebases actually fires: `origin/<branch>` only when the branch
  exists on `origin`, `origin/<default>` whenever your branch is not the default one.

## [0.13.0-alpha] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **First-run setup now sets up the three things a new install otherwise has to go looking
  for.** Step 1 gained each space's **knowledge-notes folder** (on its own line inside the
  space's block, since a name, a path and two folder pickers side by side leave neither
  placeholder readable), the **ticket tracker URL** that turns a ticket key on a card into a
  link, and the **card density**. Without them a first session ran with no vault, unlinked
  ticket keys, and whatever density happened to be the default.

  Setting a vault here also switches the knowledge feature on — a `vaultPath` with
  `knowledge.enabled` false is a folder nothing ever writes to. It never switches it off.
- **The density choice shows you the result instead of describing it.** Settings has answered
  the same question since 0.9 with three choices beside a live sample card that loses its
  prose line, then its icon row, as you click. Rather than write a second copy of that block,
  it moved into a `<template>` that both places instantiate, and its click handler became one
  delegated listener — so the two pickers cannot drift, and either one updates the other.

## [0.12.1-alpha] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- **First-run setup was hiding sessions someone had worked in.** Reported as "Load more only
  reaches 25, I'm sure I have more". There is no cap — the paged path has none — but any
  transcript whose first user turn carried slash-command markup was treated as a one-off,
  which is true of every `/start-session` as much as of a headless `/sync-refs` run. On a
  123-transcript store that hid two real sessions among 47 genuine automation runs. What
  separates them is whether a person went on to type in it, so the command is now remembered
  rather than acted on and the transcript is skipped only when no human prompt is ever found:
  27 importable instead of 25, and the automation runs still hidden. Two harness injections
  also stopped counting as prompts — "Continue from where you left off." on a resume and
  "[Request interrupted by user]" — or those sessions would have surfaced titled with them.
- **The wizard now accounts for what the scan left out** — "27 importable, out of 123
  transcripts on this machine (49 already in the app, 47 automation runs left out)". Someone
  who counts their own sessions and sees a smaller number cannot tell a filter from a cap,
  and will read it as a cap.
- **The session preview was invisible.** It shipped in 0.12.0 — toggle, panel, Rust command,
  API binding all in the tag — as a bare 11px chevron in the faintest text colour between
  the title and two dropdowns, which reads as a separator. It is now a labelled
  "▸ Preview" / "▾ Hide" button. A control that is present and reported missing is missing.

### Fixed
- **Six places still promised a staged diff review** after the loop stopped requiring one.
  The worst was `/skill-propose`'s own first hard rule — "NEVER write to `~/.claude/skills/`,
  no exceptions" — which its own Step 3c does; an agent reading the file would follow the
  rule and never use the fast path. The invariant was never "never write", it is "never
  without the user seeing the exact wording first", and it now says so. `/save-session` and
  `/close-session` repeated the old claim to their callers; the landing page said it in the
  hero, the meta description and the Problem→Solution map.

## [0.12.0-alpha] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- **First-run setup brings your existing sessions in.** A fresh install opens a three-step
  wizard: spaces and categories first, then the Claude Code sessions already on the machine,
  then one import pass. The order is not cosmetic — the backend refuses a category the config
  does not carry, and the shipped seed points "Work" at `~/work`, a path that exists on almost
  no machine, so importing before the taxonomy is real would either fail or file someone's
  notes into a folder they never chose.

  Each session carries **its own** space and category, defaulted to the first category under a
  space that exists so finishing the step costs no clicks. A `▸` on each row expands what the
  session opened with and what it left off at, read from the two ends of its transcript only:
  the head stops at the first real user turn (so previewing one session costs less than the
  scan that listed it) and the tail seeks the last 64 KB rather than streaming a file that can
  run to tens of megabytes.

  It only ever opens by itself on an install with nothing in it — an absent marker is not
  enough, since every install predating the feature has one. **Settings → First-run setup**
  re-runs it, and the list's empty state offers it too.

### Removed
- **Adopt and Import are gone from the daily surface.** The `＋ Import` button, the
  "Recent · unmanaged" section and the Adopt button on its rows are removed, along with the
  import modal behind them. Once a session is tracked there is no reason to start the next one
  outside the dashboard, so a permanent import affordance advertised a workflow the product
  argues against — and it was the part of the app people found least intuitive. Importing now
  happens in first-run setup, or from the two entry points above.

### Fixed
- **Doctor's advice for a live unregistered session was impossible to follow.** It said
  "Reopen it from Running", which a running process cannot do — `claude --resume` refuses a
  session already in use. It now says to quit the pid first, then re-run first-run setup.
- **A failed import no longer blocks its own retry.** The `/import-session` skill writes the
  `notes.md` before it registers the session, so a run that died between the two left an
  orphan that the skill's own "Already managed" guard then used to refuse every retry. The
  failure path predicts the path the skill computes and undoes it, guarded by the same
  two-levels-below-a-space rule the delete path uses. A slow import that *did* register is
  reported as the success it is rather than as a timeout.

### Changed
- **A skill proposal raised in a live session is now settled in that session.** The loop
  always staged its work and pointed at `/skills-review`, so approving meant reading a diff
  days later with no memory of why it was written — worse review, not safer review. When the
  user is present and the trigger is the loud one (they corrected the same thing twice),
  `/skill-propose` now says so on the spot, shows the **verbatim** change or a scope card for
  a new skill, and applies it on a clear yes. Anything else — an ambiguous answer, a headless
  `/wrap-session`, a background run — still stages, and `/skills-review` still promotes it.

  The approval did not go away, only the waiting: the gate before is traded for a cheap undo
  after, so the fast path is required to go through `patch_apply.py` (which re-checks every
  anchor at write time) and to append to `~/.claude/skills-applied.log`, which holds the diff
  and is the revert. New-skill creations are logged in the same header shape, since
  `/skills-review` lists the log with `grep '^==='` and a free-form line would be invisible
  there rather than merely untidy.

## [0.11.4-alpha] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **`/skills-review` now records the patches it applies.** Approving a patch deleted its
  proposal and marked nothing, so an applied patch left no trace outside the file itself —
  and the loop-health report, which only ever counted new skills, would say "never" after a
  run of approved patches. Applying one now appends its diff to an append-only
  `~/.claude/skills-applied.log` (captured *before* the patch lands, since the anchors stop
  matching afterwards), and the report reads that log. The log's real job is recovery: when
  an installer or an app update overwrites a patched skill with the upstream copy, it is the
  only way to know what was lost and replay it.

### Fixed
- **The usage bar painted no background.** It asked for `--surface-bg`, a custom property
  that was never defined anywhere in the stylesheet, so the declaration resolved to nothing.
  On most pages that would show whatever sits behind; this webview is deliberately
  non-opaque (the fix for the white flash on resize), so the bar showed straight through to
  the desktop and the terminal beneath it read as overlapping text. It now uses
  `--surface-modal`, the defined token for chrome that sits over content.

## [0.11.3-alpha] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **The clippy gate is green again.** It had been failing since 0.11.1 on a complex return
  type in the skills sync, so the release before this one shipped with a red CI. Named the
  two multi-value returns and cleared a stray no-op — no behaviour changed.
- **A session whose terminal process died no longer reads as running for ever.** An
  embedded `claude` that ended on its own — the user typed `exit`, it crashed, something
  killed it from outside — stayed in the process table as `<defunct>` until the app waited
  on it, and the app only did that on exit, on close, or on the next attach to that same
  terminal. `kill(pid, 0)` succeeds on a zombie, so in between the session showed as
  running with no terminal behind it and Resume answered *"this session is already
  active"* about a process that was already dead. The poll now reaps exited children, so
  that window lasts one tick instead of until the next app restart.

### Added
- **Clean — review old sessions by age and act on the ones you pick.** Settings → General
  audits every closed, stale and archived session and proposes what to archive (default:
  no activity for 30 days) and what to delete (default: archived for 90 days). Nothing is
  pre-ticked and nothing is swept automatically; archiving stays reversible from the
  Archived tab, and a deletion moves the session folder to the Trash. Age is the same fold
  the list's age pill already shows — the more recent of the notes.md mtime and the
  transcript's last message — so the audit never disagrees with the date on screen. A
  session Clean cannot date at all is counted and left out rather than guessed at.
- **Doctor — find what is broken in the session store, and repair what you pick.** Settings →
  General runs a read-only scan and lists named findings; nothing is written until you tick
  one. Five checks: a registry entry whose `notes.md` is gone; a frontmatter `session_id`
  pointing at a conversation that no longer exists while a sibling id survives; a session
  the notes record as closed or archived while its process is still alive — the state that
  makes Resume answer *"this session is already active"*; a pidfile whose process has exited;
  and a hand-edited skill, reported without a repair because the skills sync already archives
  a copy before it overwrites.
- Doctor reports only what it can prove. A pruned transcript is ordinary ageing, and a
  `notes.md` registered under several session ids is the Resume fallback working as designed
  — neither is damage. On a real 113-session store that is the difference between three
  findings and sixty-four.

## [0.11.2-alpha] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **A failed PR lookup no longer wipes the state Sync already knew** — `sync_pr_status`
  overwrote each PR's cached entry unconditionally, so a single `gh pr view` that failed
  (a network blip, a throttle, the wrong `gh` account active for a private repo) replaced
  a real `merged`/`open`/`closed` with `unknown`. That is exactly how a correctly-synced
  PR reads as un-synced — a dashed glyph, close to draft — right after a Sync that
  happened to fail for it. On failure the previous state and its timestamp are now kept
  untouched (nothing was re-checked, so the time must not claim otherwise), the same
  fallback the title already used; `unknown` is written only for a PR with no prior entry
  at all. 4 new tests.

## [0.11.1-alpha] - 2026-09-01

### Changed
- **The app's session skills are app-owned, and keep themselves current** — nobody
  customises File > Save, and the lifecycle skills (`/start-session`, `/close-session`…)
  are the same kind of primitive: if editing one ever feels necessary, that is product
  feedback, not a customisation need. So the app now syncs them silently at launch, the
  way any app maintains its own resources — no update banner asking permission, no
  Settings trip. Two rules make the silence safe. *Direction*: an app built before your
  last `install.sh --force` run stands down instead of reverting it at every launch
  (the epoch manifest both installers already stamp decides). *No silent loss*: a skill
  edited outside the installers — detected against its `.ao-base/` snapshot — has its
  current content copied to `~/.claude/skills/.archive/<name>.pre-sync-<ts>/` before
  the overwrite, and a passive, dismissible notice names what changed and where the
  copy went. Settings keeps one button ("Sync skills to this version") for forcing this
  build's versions on demand; the first-launch install banner still asks before writing
  anything at all. `/skill-propose` now flags a patch aimed at an app-owned skill as
  upstream feedback: staged as usual, but reported as something the next sync will
  overwrite and that belongs in the app's repo if it survives review. 6 new Rust tests
  (direction guard, backup-on-hand-edit, manual override, bootstrap of a pre-tracking
  install); `install.sh` mirrors the `.ao-base/` snapshots so the app's hand-edit
  detection stays accurate after a repo install.

## [0.11.0-alpha] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **"Install / update" warns before it would go backward** — the button force-overwrites
  session skills with whatever this build shipped, but a repo fix landed *after* a given
  app version was built stays invisible to it: overwriting with that older bundle looked
  identical to a real update. Both installers (the app, and `scripts/install.sh --force`)
  now stamp `~/.claude/skills/.ao-install-manifest.json` with the date of the last commit
  that touched `skills/`, and the app's own bundle carries the same date baked in at
  compile time (`build.rs`). The confirm dialog compares the two: "This would go
  backward" when the on-disk skills are already the same age or newer, a plain "is
  newer" note when the bundle really is an update, and the original neutral wording when
  either date is unknown (an older app, or a fresh `install.sh` that predates this). 3
  new tests.
- **A launch banner offers the update, instead of waiting for a trip to Settings** — when
  the bundle-date check above finds session skills present but genuinely behind, the app
  now nudges at startup the same way it already does for a fresh install, naming which
  skills changed. The banner's own button opens the exact same confirm dialog Settings
  does before applying anything — a newer bundle date doesn't rule out a skill you
  edited locally after the last stamp, so the named-diff warning still gets a look before
  anything is overwritten. Dismissal is keyed to that build's date, so declining today's
  offer doesn't silence a later one. The comparison and dialog wording now live in one
  shared module, `renderer/lib/skills-status-copy.js`, used by both surfaces. 11 new
  tests.

### Fixed
- **`/skills-review`'s loop-health check no longer mistakes a documentation example for
  a real approval** — a plain `grep` for `origin: agent-proposed` over every `SKILL.md`
  also matched `skills-curate` and `skill-propose`, which both document that frontmatter
  key inside a fenced example in their own body, and reported that example's literal
  template placeholder as the most recent approval date. Reads the frontmatter block
  only now, and renames the message to make explicit that this check only ever sees
  **new** skills, not patches to existing ones.

## [0.10.0-alpha] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- **An opt-in hook nudges `/learn` the moment a preference or correction is typed** —
  `/learn` and `/skill-propose` already say "use PROACTIVELY" in their own description,
  but nothing forced the check at the actual turn it mattered, so the knowledge notes
  only grew when you asked for it by name. `hooks/learn_nudge.py` runs on
  `UserPromptSubmit`: it matches your message against a short, high-precision phrase list
  ("always", "never", "from now on", "je préfère", "ne ... plus"...) and, on a hit,
  injects a one-line reminder for the model to check `/learn`'s or `/skill-propose`'s own
  criteria — silently, so a message that doesn't actually qualify produces no visible
  output. Throttled to once per session per 15 minutes. Install with
  `bash scripts/install.sh --with-hooks`, same opt-in path as the PR-attach hook; wiring
  into `settings.json` is printed, never written for you. 14 tests.

### Changed
- **The skill-learning loop is on by default** — `skillProposals` shipped as an opt-in, so
  `/close-session` and `/save-session` never offered to capture what a session taught
  unless the key was set by hand, and the key was written nowhere: absent from Settings
  and from the seed config. A loop nobody can discover reads as a dead feature rather
  than an opt-out, and the absence was invisible — `/skills-review` reported "nothing
  pending" whether the gate was off or there was genuinely nothing to propose. Fixed on
  both sides: `default_config()` now writes `skillProposals: true` for a fresh install,
  and an absent key reads as on for every config written before the key existed, so
  nobody has to re-run Settings to pick it up. An explicit `false` still wins, so opting
  out stays possible.

### Fixed
- **Resume stops shadowing itself when the frontmatter session_id is dead** — the
  effective resumable id fell back to the newest registered id only when the
  frontmatter's own `session_id` had the WRONG SHAPE (a `/start-session` stub
  placeholder). A well-formed but dead id — its transcript deleted, or the frontmatter
  hand-edited or copied from another session — satisfied that check and the fallback
  never ran, so a ticket with several real, later conversations recorded against it
  could offer Restart and never Resume, permanently. The choice now checks whether the
  frontmatter id's conversation actually exists on disk, not just whether it looks like
  one.

## [0.9.0-alpha] - 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Sync realigns a session's tickets and PRs, instead of only refreshing PR states** — it
  discovered nothing: a pull request opened after the last checkpoint stayed invisible
  however often you pressed the button, and ticket statuses were never touched, so a board
  showing `Triaged` for something long since `Done` had no way back. The name promised more
  than the button did.

  It now runs two passes. First the new **`/sync-refs`** headless: the agent reads each
  ticket's current status through the tracker MCP, asks `gh` for the pull requests whose
  branch names one of the session's tickets, and rewrites the frontmatter. Then the
  existing `gh` pass for each PR's state and title.

  The app gains no credentials from this. Reading a tracker needs an account, and an agent
  already has one through MCP — which is also why the pass costs a few tokens and some
  seconds rather than being instant. There is no `--resume`: this needs the session's
  frontmatter, not its conversation.

  Statuses are **replaced** — a status is a snapshot, and a stale one presented as current
  is the entire problem being fixed. PR links are only ever **added**: a link attached by
  hand is a deliberate act, and pruning belongs to the editor.

## [0.8.3-alpha] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- **A session opens at the root of its space — one rule, every session** — the working
  directory used to come from wherever `claude` happened to be started the first time,
  which made it a property of history rather than of configuration: move a space in
  Settings and its older sessions kept opening at the old place, with nothing in the UI
  able to correct it. It is now resolved from the space the session belongs to, on both
  launch paths and from every tab. A session outside every configured space — an unmanaged
  one — keeps the directory it recorded, since that is the only thing known about it.

  This also replaces the launch-time narrowing shipped in 0.8.1 and 0.8.2, which moved a
  session into its own notes folder. That cut sessions off from the repositories sitting
  beside their notes, which is usually the reason the space root is the useful answer.

## [0.8.2-alpha] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **The working directory rule reached the historical tabs** — 0.8.1 applied it to running
  sessions only, so a resume from Closed or Archived still used the older behaviour. Both
  read paths were brought in line.

## [0.8.1-alpha] - 2026-08-13

### Changed
- **First pass at deciding a session's working directory from configuration** — it had
  been taken from wherever `claude` was first started, recorded in the transcript. This
  release moved it towards the session's own folder; 0.8.3 settled on the space root,
  which is the rule that shipped.

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **A pull request tells you whether it is open, merged or closed** — the cards carried a
  link to each PR and nothing about its state, so the one question you actually have (is
  this still waiting on me?) meant opening GitHub. The GitHub mark is now tinted by state
  in the list and on the board, and the detail panel spells each PR out as a labelled chip
  with its title: `#5107 test: assert the route-instruction source holds no features`.
  Colour never carries the meaning alone — every state also has a mark, both for
  colour-blind readers and because green / orange / red are already the session status dot
  a few pixels away on the same card.
- **Sync is a button, and the only thing here that touches the network** — no timer, and no
  Settings toggle either, since the button *is* the opt-in. The promise becomes "zero
  network until you press Sync", which is one honest asterisk rather than a preference
  someone can forget having enabled. State comes from `gh` with your existing login,
  cached in `~/.config/ai-agents-orchestrator/pr-status.json` — never in `notes.md`, whose
  frontmatter belongs to you and the session skills. A PR never synced reads *not synced*,
  not blank: blank would say "no PR here".
- **A ticket shows its tracker's own status word** — `In Review`, `Triaged`, whatever your
  project calls it, since folding those into three words of ours would lose the
  distinction the project actually works with. Only the *colour* is folded, into the same
  families as a PR: one grammar for both — moving, finished, abandoned, in draft, nothing
  yet. The status comes from a `ticket_states:` frontmatter list written by the session
  skills, so the app holds no tracker credentials. It shows on the icon, in the picker,
  and as a chip per ticket in the detail panel, beside the PRs.
- **Close wraps a stale session up for real, without opening a terminal** — it used to
  stamp a marker and nothing else, landing the session in Closed with no summary and no PR
  attached. It now resumes the session headless and lets the new `/wrap-session` write the
  actual wrap-up. That skill is `/close-session` steps 1–6 and nothing else: no distil, no
  skill proposal, no questions, since `--print` has no one to answer them. The close marker
  is what *means* Closed, so the app verifies the file rather than the exit code and stamps
  the plain marker itself on failure or timeout — a session you asked to close never stays
  stale.

### Changed
- **Restart only appears when Resume cannot** — where Resume works it is strictly better,
  and a compaction already resets the context, so two buttons only made the choice harder.
  Restart survives for sessions whose transcript is gone, where rebuilding from the notes
  is the sole option.
- **One door per action in the detail panel** — the standing Edit button is gone: both
  pickers already end in "Add / edit…", so it was a second way into one dialog. It
  survives only when neither picker exists, which is exactly when you need it to attach a
  first PR or ticket. The ticket and PR icons now always open their picker, single link
  included, which is what makes dropping Edit safe.
- **"End session" is "Close session"** — the rest of the lifecycle already said Closed
  everywhere; only the terminal's own button said End, which read as a fourth state.
- **One look-card grid for Appearance, Categories and Board columns** — board colours drew
  flat colour blocks while the other two drew a tinted card with the accent as an inner
  dot, which is why that panel read as belonging to a different app. The block had been
  copy-pasted three times and the copies had drifted; it is now one shared renderer, and
  the round colour dot one rule instead of two sizes.
- **Reference links tint on hover instead of underlining** — these rows are dense and full
  of monospaced ids, where an underline crowds the descenders and reads as noise.

- **`/skill-propose` fires in flight, and counts rewrite passes** — its criteria already
  covered "the user corrected your approach", but the skill was reachable only from the
  session close, so the strongest signal available went unnoticed while it was happening.
  Measured on a real session: three rewrite passes of the same review comments, both
  rejections traceable to gaps in the writing skill, and no proposal until the user asked
  for one. It is now proactive, and a *second* rewrite pass of one output is a criterion in
  its own right — a first attempt that followed the instructions and was still wrong means
  the instructions are what is missing. A new step locates the defect: when the corrected
  output came from a skill, that skill is the first suspect and the proposal is a patch to
  it, quoting the passage that led into the mistake.
- **The knowledge notes follow one schema, written by one skill** — `/close-session` wrote a
  whole session into `<vault>/sessions/<slug>.md`: no id, no frontmatter, no index row, so
  the search could not rank it and nothing linked to it — a fifth copy of `notes.md` rather
  than a distil. It now goes through `/learn` (one note per decision worth keeping,
  `origin: close-session`), which is the single writer that knows the vault's layout and
  extends an existing note instead of adding a near-duplicate. Promoted bullets are marked
  in `notes.md` so the next close does not promote them twice.
- **`/learn` honours the vault's own conventions** — a `README.md` or `CONVENTIONS.md` at the
  vault root is the user's contract, so it is read and followed, frontmatter keys included,
  before falling back to the built-in shape. That shape gains the keys a PARA +
  Zettelkasten vault carries and the template omitted: `projects:`, `mocs:`, and a
  `related:` filled from the notes read while searching — a note nothing points at is
  reachable only by full-text luck.
- **`/route` reads the index and the Maps of Content** — it searched the atomic notes and
  the areas while ignoring `INDEX.md` and `30-MOCs/`, so `/learn` maintained an index that
  nothing consumed. It now reads the index first (leaves before the tree is the wrong
  order, and it is where an orphan note becomes visible) and searches the MOCs alongside
  the notes. `route_search.py` gains a `mocs` mode; 16 selftests.

### Fixed
- **Saving the Edit-refs dialog no longer races itself** — it wrote tickets and PR links
  through `Promise.all`, and both commands read-modify-write the same `notes.md`. Two
  distinct failures came out of that: the temp file was derived from the target alone, so
  the second writer truncated the first one's temp and then renamed a path already moved
  away ("No such file or directory"); and both writers started from the same pre-edit
  content, so one edit was silently dropped. Temps now carry a pid and counter, and the
  two writes run in sequence.
- **One icon speaks only when the set agrees** — a session with three PRs showed a cross
  reading "closed" while two of them were still open, because the summary picked the most
  demanding state and presented it as the whole answer. Disagreement now shows no state at
  all; the picker is one click away for the detail.
- **The state marks are SVG, and drawn for the size they are shown at** — the pencil and
  the dotted ring were dingbats absent from SF Pro, so macOS substituted another face or
  drew nothing: draft and un-synced simply had no visible mark. They are also no longer
  24px icons shrunk to 11 with a heavy stroke, which read as smears.
- **The PR numbers line up** — the marks are not all the same width, so each row sized its
  own and the ids after it stepped left and right down the list.
- **Close is reachable from the Actions row, and the ticket / PR icons are back in it** —
  Close only ever existed as a hover icon on a list card, and the icons had been dropped
  from that row when the links moved into the Infos rows, which sit at the top of a pane
  you have usually scrolled past by then.
- **The Infos rows read as pairs** — the gap between two rows was the same as between a
  label and its own value, so nothing grouped.

### Documentation
- **The web page hands out builds directly** — it only ever linked to the repo, so someone
  who wanted the app had to find the releases page, then the right asset. Two download
  buttons now resolve the newest release's `.dmg` and `.AppImage` at load, with the `.deb`
  and `.rpm` beside them. Nothing is hardcoded: the asset names carry the version, and
  `releases/latest` is unusable while every release is a prerelease (the API 404s), so the
  markup links to the releases listing and a script upgrades it — offline or rate-limited,
  the static links still work. The Gatekeeper `xattr` line now sits next to the macOS
  button, where a direct downloader will actually meet it.
- **The knowledge tier leads the page instead of trailing it** — memory sat last, after
  security, so the one part that compounds over months read as a footnote. It now comes
  straight after the problem statement, covers `/learn` (a note written the moment
  something is learned, extending the note that already owns the subject rather than
  duplicating it), and adds the skills loop: `/skill-propose` stages, `/skills-review` is
  the only gate, `/skills-curate` archives and never deletes. The skill list on the page
  had drifted to the session lifecycle alone; the five knowledge skills are in it now.

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **A PR opened mid-session attaches itself to the notes** — a session's PRs come from the `pr_link:` / `pr_links:` frontmatter, and only the session skills write those keys, so a PR opened while working stayed invisible until the next `/save-session`. An opt-in `PostToolUse` hook now reads the URL `gh` prints and appends it. Because it writes, two guards matter: the command must be a `create` (never `edit` or `list`, whose output is full of other people's PRs), and the URL must come from the tool's own response, so a `--body` referencing a dependency is not mistaken for the new PR. Writes are additive, idempotent and atomic; 19 tests. Install with `bash scripts/install.sh --with-hooks`, which copies the script and prints the `settings.json` entry to paste — the wiring is left to you, since that file decides which code runs.
- **`/learn` — the knowledge notes fill as you work** — the distil was bolted to `/close-session`, so it inherited a two-step dependency: the close writes `## Decisions made`, and only then can a distil promote it. Two manual gestures in series, and a session you never close teaches the next one nothing — which is why both vaults here had gone thirty days without a single note. `/learn` writes one atomic note **the moment** something durable comes up, straight into the space's knowledge notes, bypassing `notes.md` entirely. The bar is Hermes' (its `memory` tool description, which we read rather than guessed at): preferences and corrections first, then stable environment facts, then gotchas with their workaround — with the one-line test *does writing this stop the user repeating themselves?*, and an explicit skip-list (task progress, temporary state, anything cheaply re-discovered; a reusable procedure is a skill, not a note). It **extends an existing note rather than adding a near-duplicate** — reusing `route_search.py` to find one — and links every note into `INDEX.md`, since an orphan note is one nobody finds. There is deliberately **no approval prompt**: one at every insight would defeat writing in flight, so the safeguard is that every write is announced in one line and carries its origin session. The skill ships; the always-loaded trigger is a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` snippet documented in the README, the same opt-in shape as the `/save-session` Stop hook.

### Fixed
- **A session with no references offered no way to attach one** — the detail header carried only the ticket and PR icons, and those are hidden when nothing is attached, so the Edit button was out of reach in exactly the case where you needed it. Edit now sits in the header cluster too, and stays reachable while the embedded terminal is up.
- **The default launch model is `opus[1m]` again** — restored in `pty.rs` / `lib.rs` after an earlier change moved it to `opus`. *(Entry written from the commit; correct the reason if it differs.)*
- **Two Settings fields silently discarded what you typed** — Integrations still carried *Work vault path* and *Personal vault path* inputs left over from the v1 work/personal split. No JS ever read or collected them (their ids appeared nowhere else), so a folder typed there vanished on Save while the feature looked configured. They are gone, replaced by a line pointing at the real setting: the folder lives on each **space**, under *General → Spaces*.

### Documentation
- **`/route` is listed in the guide**, and `/import-session` in the README's skills table — both are bundled and were missing from one of the two lists. The README's *What's new* also picked up the 0.6.0 features it never mentioned (clickable terminal links, references in the detail panel, browsing every untracked session).

## [0.6.1-alpha] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **The reference textareas look like every other modal field** — the Edit dialog's Tickets and Pull-requests boxes were added with no styling, so they rendered with the browser's default chrome next to the app's own inputs. They now share the input rule (same background, border, radius and focus accent), in a monospace face and without the resize grip that broke the dialog's layout.

## [0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Browse every untracked session, and adopt one without a picker** — the inline "Recent · unmanaged" section shows the 30 newest, with no way to reach anything older. `discover_sessions_page` pages through the whole set and reports the full count, so **＋Import** (back, on the left of the list's filter row) can search and page through all of them, or take a pasted session id. Conversely, **Adopt** on a row no longer opens that picker: the session is already chosen, so the dialog only asks where it should land — a list there invited adopting a *different* session than the one clicked.
- **A session adopted from a row is named after its work** — the default name came from the folder, so anything started in `~/TomTom` was adopted as "TomTom". It now uses the session's own first prompt, clipped on a word boundary; the folder is only the fallback.
- **PRs and tickets are listed in the detail panel** — each on its own row, every entry clickable, instead of the tickets being appended to the Category line and the PRs living only as a toolbar icon.
- **`/route` — a Context Brief before you investigate** — reads this space's knowledge notes, your past session notes and (when a tracker is reachable) its tickets, and summarises what is already known *before* you open the code. It resolves which notes folder to read from the current session's **space**, so nothing is hardcoded and work and personal knowledge never mix; an unmanaged terminal reads them all and says so. Layout is discovered rather than assumed — a `20-Notes/` · `10-Areas/` vault is used as such, any other folder is scanned flat — so it works for someone who just pointed a space at a notes directory. The search itself lives in `skills/lib/route_search.py` (14 selftests) rather than inline in the skill: the version this was ported from passed its query and its vault path through environment variables that nothing ever exported, so every search silently scored zero and the skill reported "no match" for its entire life. Arguments cannot be forgotten the way an export can.

### Changed
- **One Edit button instead of a pencil per field** — each reference field had its own ✎ and popover, which turned the actions row into a wall of buttons for something you edit rarely. A single ✎ now opens one dialog for every editable field, and validates all of it before writing either — a half-applied save would leave the `notes.md` disagreeing with what the box showed.
- **Persistent memory no longer looks like an Obsidian feature** — the "vault" was always just a folder of Markdown: the session skills write notes into it, `/route` reads them back, and nothing in the code has ever touched Obsidian (no URI scheme, no plugin, no API). But the naming — an *Obsidian* toggle, an *Obsidian vault* path — meant anyone without Obsidian reasonably concluded the feature was not for them, and skipped persistent memory entirely. It is now **knowledge notes**: point a space at any folder of Markdown. The config key `obsidian` became `knowledge`, the legacy name is still read everywhere (Rust, the skills' Python helper, the Settings UI), and a config only gains the new name when the app next saves it — so nothing to change by hand. `roots[].vaultPath` keeps its name: "vault" is generic, and it is a path field, not the word that was turning people away.

### Fixed
- **Links in the embedded terminal are clickable** — Claude Code prints a PR it just opened as an **OSC 8 hyperlink**, not as plain text, so `WebLinksAddon`'s regex never saw it. xterm routes those through its `linkHandler` option, which defaults to `null`: the link rendered underlined and the click was swallowed, ⌘ or not. They now open in the browser. An OSC 8 target is attacker-controlled text, so its scheme is checked before opening — `open_external` (http/https only) remains the authoritative guard.
- **A refused link no longer fails in silence** — an unsupported scheme was rejected by the backend and the renderer dropped the rejection, so clicking did nothing at all, with no message. The same fault made **Load more** look dead: it was also always visible, because an author `display` beats the browser's `[hidden]` rule. Both are fixed, and clicks are now matched by the `data-url` attribute rather than by class — matching by class is what made a newly-added kind of link silently inert.
- **Feature bullets on the landing page broke into columns** — `.feature li` is a flex container, so a bullet containing a `<strong>` or a `<code>` laid its fragments out side by side instead of as one sentence.
- **The README says what `--force` is for** — it documented that the installer will not overwrite a customised skill, but never that this is exactly why a `git pull` leaves *changed* skills behind. The Session-skills section now states the rule (`git pull && bash scripts/install.sh --force`), notes that `npm run install:skills` does not force, and warns that the app's Settings button installs the bundle compiled into *your* binary — so a stale build reinstalls stale skills.
- **A repo pull no longer half-delivers a skill update** — the installer keeps an existing skill untouched without `--force`, so pulling a version that *changes* `/close-session` or `/save-session` left them on the old copy while the new skills and libs arrived. `scripts/install.sh` now diffs each skipped skill against the bundle and ends with an explicit warning naming the ones whose updates did not arrive (an identical copy stays silent). `/skills-review` makes the same failure self-diagnosing: when the learning loop is enabled but the installed session skills carry no proposal step, it says so instead of reporting "nothing pending" — the two look identical and mean opposite things. The installer's closing skill list is now derived from the directory rather than hand-maintained, which had already gone stale.

### Documentation
- **The pitch leads with the outcome** — the hero took three sentences to reach the product, and "mission control" names a metaphor rather than a result; the README and the site now open on *every agent you're running, in one window*. Adds the memory story (a `notes.md` outliving compaction) as its own section — the most defensible claim, and it appeared nowhere on the page — and corrects copy left stale by 0.4.0, which still advertised three views after Cards was removed.
- **The knowledge-notes tier is now advertised** — the README and the landing page told the per-session story (a `notes.md` that survives compaction) and stopped there; the tier that survives *across* sessions was documented nowhere, so no visitor could know it existed. Both now carry it, with the honest boundary drawn: distilling on close ships, and a dedicated Context-Brief command to read it back is named on the roadmap rather than implied.

## [0.5.0-alpha] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **A staged skill-learning loop** — the session skills can now propose *procedural* knowledge back into `~/.claude/skills/`, the way `/distil` already promotes decisions to an Obsidian vault. Three new bundled skills:
  - **`/skill-propose`** stages what a session taught as a new skill, or (preferred) a targeted patch to an existing one. It fires only when the session actually taught something reusable — a complex task that succeeded, a dead end whose workaround is worth keeping, an approach the user corrected, a non-trivial workflow — and stays silent otherwise. Before creating anything it asks the only question that keeps a skill set from inflating: *what umbrella class does this serve, and would a maintainer write it as N skills or as one with N labelled subsections?*
  - **`/skills-review`** is the approval gate, and the **only** path by which a proposal becomes active. It shows the full content or a real diff first, and reports when the loop last produced anything so a silently dead loop is visible.
  - **`/skills-curate`** is the periodic pass over the whole collection — the vantage point from which a *cluster* is visible at all. It groups by prefix, names the umbrella, and stages merges, demotions to `references/`, or archives.
  - **Nothing is ever auto-applied, and nothing is ever deleted.** Proposals live in `~/.claude/skills-pending/`, which no session loads; the maximum destructive action is archiving into `~/.claude/skills/.archive/`, which is recoverable. Curation only ever moves skills it created itself (`origin: agent-proposed`) — hand-written and plugin skills are reported, never touched.
  - Off by default: the `/close-session` · `/save-session` hook is gated on `skillProposals: true` in the config, like the existing Obsidian distil.
- **Per-skill usage tracking** (`skills/lib/skill_usage.py`) — derives `use_count` and `last_activity_at` per skill from the transcripts' `attributionSkill` field, and runs the lifecycle `active → stale (30 d) → archived (90 d)` on real activity rather than on anyone's judgement. A never-used skill is protected by a grace floor: no usage is *absence of evidence*, not evidence of uselessness. Reading the transcripts rather than hooking the `Skill` tool is deliberate — a `PostToolUse` hook only sees skills the *agent* invoked, and would systematically undercount the ones you type yourself (`/close-session`, `/eod`). The first scan backfills months of history; later scans are incremental.

### Fixed
- **Patch proposals are machine-checked, not eyeballed** (`skills/lib/patch_apply.py`) — a replacement routinely contains its own ``` fenced blocks, and a three-backtick wrapper ended at the first inner fence, silently truncating it and writing broken instructions into a skill. The format now requires a five-backtick wrapper, and one shared applier refuses rather than guesses: a wrapper that is too short, an unclosed fence, an anchor that does not match exactly once, or a patch already applied. That last guard matters for the "insert before X" shape, where the anchor still matches after a first apply — re-running such a patch used to duplicate the insertion.

## [0.4.1-alpha] - 2026-08-10

A fix release, mostly from the first external users' feedback.

### Added
- **Resuming an archived session un-archives it** — Resume left the ARCHIVED marker in place, so the session showed under Running only while its process lived, then snapped straight back to Archived the moment its terminal died. The marker is now stripped on every resume path (detail buttons, terminal pill, embedded toggle), mirroring what `/restart-session` already did. A session you pick back up rejoins the normal lifecycle and lands in Closed when it stops.

### Fixed
- **iTerm2 hotkey windows are revealed properly** — *Reveal window* selected the session's tab but never showed the window, because a hotkey window is hidden by iTerm's own mechanism rather than being an ordinary window. It now uses iTerm's `reveal hotkey window`. This one silently caused a second bug: with the reveal appearing to do nothing, the natural move on the "already running" warning was *Open anyway* — which starts a second process on the same conversation and forks it.
- **Terminal link clicks no longer fail silently** — an unsupported URL scheme was rejected by the backend and the renderer dropped the rejection, so clicking such a link did nothing at all, with no message. Refused opens now surface. `file://` stays deliberately unsupported: terminal output is untrusted text, and a printed `file:///…/x.app` would launch on a single click.
- **`/restart-session` no longer leaves the notes and the registry disagreeing** — it registered the new session id in `active-sessions.json` but left the `notes.md` frontmatter `session_id` on the previous one. Since the dashboard resolves a historical card from that frontmatter, the card offered to resume the *old* conversation while the registry pointed at the new one, and the real session was findable only by its transcript id.
- **CI is green again** — `clippy::type_complexity` is an error under CI's `-D warnings`, which had left master red since 2026-07-22.

### Documentation
- **A TL;DR at the top of the README** and the gaps the first external users hit, filled in [the guide](docs/GUIDE.md): the embedded terminal is the intended way to run sessions (not merely an option), **Adopt** exists for sessions started outside the app, and one session means one process.

## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Several PRs / tickets per session** — a task that spans two PRs (or an epic plus its sub-task) no longer has to pick one. The `notes.md` frontmatter gained optional `pr_links:` / `tickets:` lists next to the existing `pr_link:` / `ticket:` primaries (additive — nothing that already writes those keys changed). With more than one link the card's GitHub icon / ticket chip show a **count badge** (`+1`) and open a **picker popover** listing `owner/repo#123`; a single link still opens straight away as before. The inline editor is now **one entry per line** and is no longer REVIEW-only — any session with a `notes.md` can attach PRs or tickets, tickets included (new `set_tickets` write, same ADR-013 guards as `set_pr_links`: atomic, confined under a configured root, validated). `/save-session` and `/close-session` now **append** discovered PRs/tickets to those lists instead of only filling an empty field.

### Removed
- **The Cards view is gone** — it overlapped the Kanban board without being as useful, so the app is now **List + Board**. The `▦ Cards` toggle, the cards grid and its topbar/search/filter are removed; the `v` shortcut, which used to flip list ⇄ cards, now flips **list ⇄ board** (so one key gets you back out of the board). Card **density** (Detailed / Compact / Minimal) stays — it now applies to the list cards only, and the Settings preview renders a list card to match. The detail slide-over + scrim remain, used by the Board.

### Fixed
- **A session skill can no longer hijack the terminal it runs in** — `/start-session`, `/restart-session` and `/import-session` all bind the current terminal's session id to a `notes.md` in `active-sessions.json`, and each did so unconditionally. Run one in a terminal that already held *different* work and the previous entry was silently overwritten: the `notes.md` survived on disk, but that session vanished from the dashboard and from `/list-sessions`. All three now check what the id already pointed at and ask before proceeding, offering to do the work in a fresh terminal instead. (`/start-session`'s guard existed locally but had never been carried into the repo, so a `--force` skills install dropped it.)

### Changed
- **List view: pinned sessions float to the top of the whole column** — previously they floated per *space* (and, before that, per category), which defeated the point of a pin as your "current threads" shortlist. They now sit in one block at the top, cross-space, just below **⚡ Needs you** (blocked work still outranks a pin; a session that's both appears only under Needs you). No header and no category/space label on the cards — the filled bookmark stays the only marker.

## [0.3.1-alpha] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **"Recent · unmanaged" section + Adopt** — a collapsible section at the top of the Running tab lists recently-active Claude Code sessions that aren't yet managed by the dashboard (on disk under `~/.claude`, no `notes.md`). It's **lazy** (discovered only when you expand it — never on the 5-second poll, so hundreds of on-disk sessions cost nothing) with a ↻ rescan. Each row has a single **Adopt** action = resume + register in one gesture, reusing the Import modal preselected on that session; once adopted, the row leaves the list. The old top-level **＋Import** button was removed — Adopt covers it inline.
- **List-view organization (drag to reorder + group)** — in the List view you can now **drag-reorder your categories** (persisted) and move the **Recent · unmanaged** block anywhere; **drag-reorder sessions** within their category; and **group related sessions** (e.g. sub-tickets of one parent) by **dragging one session onto another**, Kanban-style. Groups are collapsible, colour-coded by their category (board-style border), renamable via a pencil icon, and auto-dissolve below two members. Everything stays **within a category** (no cross-category moves) and is scoped to the Running tab. Clicking into a session's embedded terminal now **selects + reveals** its card in the list.
- **Per-session usage bar** — the footer bar's **context %** and **model** now follow the **selected session** instead of "whichever session last rendered its statusline". The bundled `ao-statusline.sh` writes a per-session keyed cache (`{ global, sessions: { <id> } }`); the app shows the selected session's context/model and hides them when a session has no data. The **5-hour / weekly** windows stay account-global. The legacy flat cache is still read, so nothing breaks on upgrade.

### Fixed
- **Usage bar no longer blanks after a resume** — Claude Code omits `rate_limits` on some renders (notably right after a resume); the wrapper now keeps the last-known 5h/7d values instead of clearing the bars.
- **macOS "damaged" on first open** — documented the real fix (`xattr -cr` to clear the Gatekeeper quarantine) in the README and release notes; the old "right-click → Open" no longer works on recent macOS.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **"Claude Desktop" group for unmanaged Desktop-app sessions** — a live session opened via the Claude Desktop app (not Claude Code CLI) has no `notes.md`/category, so it used to land in the generic "OTHER" group in List/Cards. It now groups under its own **"Claude Desktop"** label instead, based on the pidfile's `entrypoint`.
- **Usage status bar** — a slim bottom bar showing your **model**, the **5-hour** and **weekly** rate-limit windows (colour-coded, with reset countdowns), and the current **context %**. Works **automatically** for sessions launched from the dashboard: the app installs a bundled statusline wrapper (`~/.claude/ao-statusline.sh`) and injects it per-launch via `claude --settings` (never edits your global `settings.json`). The wrapper writes `~/.claude/statusline-cache.json`, which the app reads **read-only**, then delegates to your own statusline so your terminal display is unchanged. Hidden when no cache exists, dimmed when stale.
- **Bundled `/save-session` skill** — the repo now ships a generic `save-session` (checkpoint the active session into `notes.md` mid-flight, marked `(in progress)`, without closing it) alongside start/close/restart/archive/import/rename. README also documents an **opt-in** Stop hook that nudges you to `/save-session` as context fills (≈50/75/90%) — not auto-installed; the app never edits your global `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **In-app session-skills installer** — the app now bundles the session skills (embedded at compile time) and can install/refresh them into `~/.claude/skills/` itself: a first-launch banner offers a one-click install when they're missing, and **Settings → Backup → Session skills** has an *Install / update skills* button (force-refresh, for after an app upgrade). A `.dmg`-only install is now self-sufficient — no git clone + `install.sh` needed. The installer also seeds a default config if absent and pre-creates the category folders. Writes only under `~/.claude/skills/`, user-triggered.
- **Linux support** 🐧 — runs on X11 and Wayland (verified on GNOME/Wayland); `cargo tauri build` produces `.deb`/`.AppImage`. External terminals resolve via `$TERMINAL`/`xdg-open` and the standard emulators; the macOS-only *reveal-existing-window* button is hidden on Linux. *(First external contribution — thanks [@FelixDombek-TomTom](https://github.com/FelixDombek-TomTom), #1.)*
- **CI + bundle-freshness guard** — a GitHub Actions workflow runs clippy/tests, and `npm run check:bundle` fails if the vendored `renderer/xterm-bundle.js` drifts from its source. *(Contributed by [@FelixDombek-TomTom](https://github.com/FelixDombek-TomTom), #2.)*
- **Import → v2 spaces** — the Import modal now picks a **space** (dropdown, like ＋New) instead of the old Work/Personal toggle, filters categories by space, and threads `--root` through `import_session` + the `/import-session` skill so the adopted notes.md lands under the chosen space.
- **Import by session ID** — paste a session ID to import one that isn't in the recent-transcripts list.
- **Import: Embedded / Terminal toggle** — adopt a session in the in-app terminal (keyed by its real id, links to the card with no re-key) or an external tab, sharing the `Open in` pref.

### Security
- **Rust security & robustness audit** — a full pass (Fable-assisted, each finding adversarially reviewed) hardened the backend; every change verified with clippy + the test suite green:
  - `alive()` now clamps a session's pid to `pid_t` range before the `kill(2)` cast — an oversized value from a foreign-written pidfile wrapped negative, and `kill(-pgid, 0)` probes a whole **process group**, so a dead session could read as *alive*.
  - `atomic_write` now `fsync`s the temp file before the rename (and `config::save` shares the one helper) — a crash in the writeback window could otherwise replace a good `notes.md`/config with an **empty** file.
  - `delete_session` refuses to remove a path that is a configured root or category directory (requires ≥2 levels below the longest matching root).
  - One `is_valid_session_id` + one `is_safe_slug` validator across `lib`/`reader`/`pty` — the sessionId/slug allowlists (which guard both shell-command folding and `{sid}.jsonl` path building, so nothing can traverse out of `~/.claude/projects`) now live in one audited place.

### Fixed
- **Active session showed a green (idle) dot while working** — Claude Code's pidfile `status` can lag (stays `idle` while the main loop is busy). The Running tab now infers **busy** when the session's transcript was written in the last few seconds, overriding a stale `idle` (`waiting`/`shell` left untouched).
- **Orphaned `claude` process on terminal-spawn failure** — if wiring the pty's I/O failed *after* the child spawned, the child ran unmanaged forever (never in the session map, so no kill could reach it) and its shell lingered as a zombie. It's now killed + reaped on that error path.
- **A session can reopen after its embedded terminal exits naturally** — the dead pty entry is reaped and dropped, so a later Resume/Restart isn't wrongly blocked as "already running".
- **`＋New` with a title that has no letters or digits** (e.g. "…" or accents-only) is now rejected in the form, instead of creating a mis-keyed session at `<base>/<CAT>//notes.md`.
- **Poll no longer renders under the wrong tab** — an in-flight refresh that finishes after you've switched tabs is discarded instead of painting stale rows.
- **Imported sessions classify correctly** — the bootstrap history line `/import-session` writes is now marked `(in progress)`, so an adopted session shows as active rather than mis-bucketed.
- **Git-info cache no longer grows unbounded** — entries for closed/vanished session cwds are evicted on insert (they used to accumulate for the app's lifetime).
- **Fresh-install accent didn't match the default look** — with no saved accent, the app fell back to a hardcoded electric blue instead of the default **Ardoise** look's slate, so a new install showed *Ardoise* selected but a blue accent (until you re-clicked it). The default accent now derives from Ardoise (`#7E93B8`).
- **"End session" left a session stale when it had a prior close entry** — `notes_closed_since` (the poll that tells End session the wrap-up landed, so it can kill the pty) returned true as soon as the notes.md was *touched* and its status was "closed" — but an older close entry already reads as "closed". So `/close-session`'s early section writes bumped the mtime and killed the pty before it appended today's close line → no fresh close → `reopened_after_close` (transcript touched today > the old close date) flipped it back to stale. It now requires the latest close entry to be dated **today**.
- **Age pill showed a stale timestamp after Pause** — Pause kills the pty without touching `notes.md`, so the notes file's mtime (`updatedAt`) could be days old even though you'd just worked the session today. The age (and "Last activity" tooltip) now takes the **more recent** of `updatedAt` (notes.md mtime) and `lastActivityAt` (the transcript's last message) rather than a fixed priority — and historical sessions (stale/closed/archived) now carry `lastActivityAt` too (previously only live ones did).
- **Lifecycle: age pill replaces the "stale" badge, new Pause action** — every card (Running, Closed, Archived) now shows a compact "⏱ 3d" age pill (time since last activity) in its icon row, instead of an alarming "stale" text badge (the detail panel's status word is now the calmer "IDLE"). A new **Pause** button (⏸, shown when a session has a live embedded terminal) kills just that terminal — no wrap-up, no close marker — so the session goes idle but **stays in Running**, ready to Resume later. Distinct from **Close** (done → Closed tab): Pause is for "I'll come back to this," Close is for "finished, pending review."
- **Resume offered for stub sessions** — a `/start-session` stub leaves `session_id` as a `to fill (…)` placeholder, so the dashboard only ever offered *Restart*. The reader now falls back to the latest real session id registered to that notes.md in `active-sessions.json` (whose transcript still exists), so **Resume** is offered when a resumable transcript is available.
- **Embedded terminal re-reveal survives resume (no more false "already running")** — a session resumed twice gets a new sessionId each time, but its terminal was keyed by the *old* sid, so after switching away the dashboard couldn't re-find it → it warned "already running" and offered a 2nd instance. Terminals are now tagged with their (stable) `notes.md` path and re-found by it, regardless of the current sid. Resume/Restart re-reveal the backgrounded terminal instead of warning.
- **Close button on stale sessions** — a stale session in the Running tab now shows a **Close** button (it used to wrongly show *Archive*). Click → it moves to **Closed** (stamps a close marker via `close_session`, no skill needed). Lifecycle granularity is now Running/Stale → **Close** → Closed → **Archive** → Archived. The *stale* badge stays until you close it, so sessions that were never `/close-session`'d stay trackable.
- **`/close-session` always records a close** — it no longer "no-ops" when there's nothing new since the last close; it appends a close entry dated **today** (skipping only a same-day duplicate). So a resumed-then-closed session reliably lands in **Closed** — and the *End session* button detects it immediately instead of waiting for its timeout.
- **"End session" now closes with an AI wrap-up — and always lands in Closed** — the embedded terminal's *End session ✕* button used to just kill the process, leaving the session **stale** (nothing written to notes.md). It now injects `/close-session` (submitted with `\r`) so Claude writes the full summary, polls until that close is recorded, then kills the pty → **Closed** with a real wrap-up. If no fresh wrap-up appears within the timeout (nothing new to summarise, or the session is in plan mode), it **stamps a close marker directly** (like Archive) and ends → still **Closed**, never stale. A second click ends immediately.
- **Resume/Restart now launch in `--permission-mode auto`** — previously only `+New`/Import did. If your default is **plan mode**, a resumed session started in plan, so `/close-session` and `/save-session` (which write `notes.md`) bailed at their plan-mode check — the close never recorded and the session lingered as **"stale"** in Running. All four launch sites (Resume/Restart × embedded/external) now force auto, matching `+New`.
- **Resumed archived/closed session showed as "OTHER"** — the Running tab resolved category/root only from `active-sessions.json` (by session id), so a session resumed after being archived/closed (de-registered) appeared uncategorised with no workspace. It now relinks to the managed `notes.md` whose history records that `session=<id>`, recovering category/ticket/root — and is excluded from its historical bucket while live (no double-listing).
- **Embedded `+New` terminal — false "already running"** — resuming a `+New` session (whose terminal is keyed by `notesPath`) checked liveness only by `sessionId`, so it warned "already running" instead of re-revealing the backgrounded terminal. It now matches either key and re-reveals.
- **`/close-session` relink** — a resumed session whose id isn't in `active-sessions.json` now finds its `notes.md` via the `session=<id>` history line (so the close records in the right place), and no longer falls back to "most recently modified session" (which could mis-route the close to a different session).
- **Import** launches the resumed session in **auto mode** (`--permission-mode auto`) so `/import-session` can write — plan mode was silently blocking the adoption.
- **False "Archived"** — a session was wrongly filed under Archived when the *word* "archived" appeared anywhere in its `notes.md` history (so the dashboard's own project, whose notes discuss archiving, kept self-archiving). The classifier now matches only the genuine `| ARCHIVED |` marker that `/archive-session` writes.
- **Archived/Closed status dot** — these showed a green ("running") dot in the List/Cards; they now use the muted grey *historical* dot (they aren't running).

## [0.2.2-alpha] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Start a new session in the embedded terminal** — ＋New now offers the same **Embedded / Terminal** destination toggle as Resume/Restart (shared `Open in` pref), so a brand-new session can open in the built-in terminal instead of an external iTerm tab.
- New sessions launch in **auto mode** (`--permission-mode auto`) so `/start-session` can write its workspace without being blocked by plan mode.

### Fixed
- **Embedded terminal — Shift+Enter** now inserts a newline instead of submitting (the Enter was leaking through and submitting).
- **Embedded terminal — scrolling** no longer intermittently sticks: the wheel drives xterm's `scrollLines` directly, bypassing a WKWebView canvas-viewport stall.
- **No white flash on window resize** — the webview is non-opaque and the native window background tracks the theme, so the growing edge shows the theme colour instead of the OS-default white.
- **rename-category** refuses to rename a category that exists under multiple spaces (it would have renamed only one and left the config inconsistent) — remove the duplicate first.
- **Session → space tagging** uses component-aware path matching, so a session under `FEAT-bug/` is no longer mis-tagged as belonging to `FEAT`.

## [0.2.1-alpha] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Spaces editor in Settings** — rename a space, set its folder (Browse), add/remove. Renaming a space retags the categories under it; each space shows its selected path on its own line.
- **Category colours from a seed + scheme** — the same generative system as the board (Spectrum / Shades / Analogous): pick a seed and the per-category colours fill from it.
- **Resizable Settings modal** — drag the corner; up to +20% wider and taller until everything fits.
- **Unified ⚲ Filter** — the filter popover now filters by **Space** *and* **Category** (the board's separate space selector was removed).

### Changed
- **List view** — pinned sessions float to the top of *each space* (no "PINNED" header); per-card space labels removed (the section header is the only space marker); the ticket/PR/notes icons sit flush-left under the title.

### Fixed
- **Restart** — closed/archived sessions restart in their **space root** (resolved from the session's `notes.md` location), not `$HOME`.
- **Board** — an empty, in-creation note no longer shows a delete trash; Escape / click-away cancels it.

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Spaces** — categories can live under multiple named spaces (e.g. *Work*, *Perso*, a client) instead of the fixed work/personal pair. **List & Cards** organise into collapsible **space sections** → category groups; the **Board** gets its own space filter next to its search; pinned / ⚡ waiting cards (which float out of their section) keep a small space tag. A category that exists in 2+ spaces (e.g. `AI-SYSTEM` under both Work and Perso) is fully supported — `＋New` has a **space dropdown** that picks which one a session lands under, and `start_session` + the `start-session` skill resolve the folder via the chosen space. Config schema v2: `roots: [{name,path}]` + a `root` per category, migrated transparently from the legacy `workRoot`/`personalRoot` + `scope`. *(A Spaces editor in Settings is still to come — add spaces by editing the config / folder picker meanwhile.)*
- **⚲ Filter popover** — the per-category chip row became a single **⚲ Filter** button + checkbox menu (deduped categories, active-count badge, one control across List/Cards/Board).
- **Import existing sessions** — a `＋Import` picker lists your recent *unmanaged* Claude Code sessions (searchable); pick one and it resumes (`claude --resume`) and is adopted into management (writes `notes.md` + registers it) under a chosen root/category. Backed by a new `discover_sessions` command and an `/import` skill. Picker hides slash-command/skill one-off runs and sub-agent sidechains.
- **Kanban board: category filters + search** — same controls as the List/Cards views, on a single filter bar.
- **Ticket as a number label** — tickets render as a clickable `PROJ-123` chip in the List, Cards, and Board (was a bare icon); clickable when a tracker URL is set, a plain label otherwise.
- **Guide + FAQ** — `docs/GUIDE.md` (session lifecycle, Start vs Resume vs Restart, notes-beat-compaction diagram) and a README FAQ on what shows up automatically vs. needs importing.
- README version badge.

### Changed
- **Licence → AI Agents Orchestrator Source Available License v1.0** (was PolyForm Noncommercial, which barred use at a for-profit). Now free to download, use, and evaluate — including in the course of professional work at a company — while prohibiting resale, redistribution, org-wide deployment, SaaS offerings, rebranding, and modified-version distribution without written permission.
- **Session skills renamed** (follows Claude's skill-naming conventions — generic single-word names are discouraged): `/start`→`/start-session`, `/close`→`/close-session`, `/restart`→`/restart-session`, `/archive`→`/archive-session`, `/import`→`/import-session` (`/rename-category` unchanged). The dashboard launcher emits the new names. **Re-run `bash scripts/install.sh --force`** and use the new commands.
- **Session skills are root-aware** — `aoconfig.py` resolves a session's folder from its category's root (with the legacy work/personal layout still supported). **Re-run `bash scripts/install.sh --force`** to update the bundled skills.
- **Board cards** — the title gets its own row; status badges + action icons moved to a foot row; the branch chip was dropped; the `STALE` badge is now the muted grey used in the List.
- **Positioning** — hero/README reframed around *AI development sessions* (mission control for the sessions you already run), not agent-spawning.
- Pre-Tauri ADRs (001–011) are clearly marked **Historical (Electron era)**; the app runs on Tauri.

### Fixed
- **`/restart` un-archive** — the revive step matched the substring `ARCHIVED` anywhere in a line and could strip legitimate `notes.md` history/decision bullets that merely mention the word. It now strips only a genuine archive marker (a `… | ARCHIVED | …` Session-history bullet).
- **Lifecycle classification** — a properly `/close`d session no longer lingers as *stale*: the classifier recognises the current `… | session=<id> | …` history format and reads the **newest-dated** entry (not the last physical line, which could be out of order).
- **Embedded terminal** — status dot updates live on the poll; returning to the List from the Board restores the open terminal; Resume/Restart route to the List view; the ⓘ info button works over the terminal.
- **Board inline editing** — Escape cancels a column/group rename or note edit (and a freshly-added empty note is removed instead of left as an orphan); the rename input survives the 5-second poll.
- **Import picker** — Escape closes it; cleaner derived titles; modal width fixed.
- **Mobile landing** — the "View on GitHub" button no longer wraps to two lines.
